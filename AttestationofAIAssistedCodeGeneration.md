Attestation of AI-Assisted Code Generation

This software project and every repository in this organization utilizes generative AI tools to assist in the development of source code. Specifically, the following tools were used:

[x] Github Copilot

[x] Gemini Code Assist

[x] Gemini (model version)

[] Amazon Q Developer

[] Other [add all other AI models used in development including the model and version]

 This/these generative AI tool(s) were employed to:
 
[x] Generate code snippets: The AI tool(s) assist in generating code blocks, functions, and classes based on natural language prompts or code comments describing the desired functionality.

[x] Generate boilerplate code: The AI tool(s) assist in generating the coding structure for classes, functions, or data structures. 

[x] Suggest code completions: While writing code, the AI tool(s) provide real-time suggestions for completing code expressions, statements, and function calls.

[x] Detect and fix bugs: The AI tool(s) analyze the code and provide feedback on potential bugs, code style issues, and optimization opportunities.

[x] Refactor code: The AI tool(s) assist in restructuring existing code to improve readability, maintainability, and efficiency.

[] Translate code: The AI tools(s) assist in translating code from one coding language to another. 

[x] Test case generation: The AI tools(s) assist in generating unit tests for code evaluation.

[] Other: 

Important Notes:

All AI-generated code was thoroughly reviewed by human developers and was subjected to standard testing procedures to ensure quality and functionality. 

This attestation is meant to provide transparency about the use of AI in the development of this software project and to protect the intellectual property rights of the State of Utah.
